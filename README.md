# Electronic-signature-loans:

## Project description: 

Confrontation of several Machine Learning algorithms to predict (classification) electronic signature of contracts. The dataset is a collection of financial info from clients  of a  private anonymous firm. The ML algorithms used were ANN, support vector machines and ensemble learning techniques: random forest classifiers, gradient boosting and adaboost. The algorithms with best score were our neural netowork and the random forest clasifier. 

## Code and resources used:
**Python version:** 3.7
**Packages:libraries:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikitlearn, math, keras.
**Datasets:** dataset from anonymous private company available in the repo.
